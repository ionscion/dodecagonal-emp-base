## Developer Notes
- This application was developed using Command Line Interface with the node inquirer package. 
- To initiate the application run the command 'node server.js' or 'npm run start'
- The main Inquirer menu features scroll-through functionality, use the arrow keys - up and down to navigate through and press enter to go into a sub-menu
- Once you've run a query you can continue selecting more options by pressing up/down on the arrow keys
- Additional functionality was developed to allow for viewing data by departments, managers, deletion of records etc.
- Since the mySQL server requires a password to enter, a local environment variable was created to store that and added to the gitIgnore file to ensure the password is not shared on a public website. 

## Future Development
- Right now the app is built around entering valid id's to perform the addition and delete functions. In the future I'd like to add functionality to call the database and render current lists.
